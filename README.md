## ðŸ“˜ Day-wise Progress

### âœ… Day 1 â€“ *HashMap Questions*  
**Date:** 16th July 2025  
**Topic:** Hashing (using `unordered_map` in C++)

**Problems Solved:**
1. ðŸ”— [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
2. ðŸ”— [First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

**Learnings:**
- How to use `unordered_map` in C++
- Frequency counting
- Pair sum logic with hashmap
- Time complexity benefits of hashing (O(1) average)

### âœ… Day 2 â€“ *Sliding Window & HashMap*  
**Date:** 17th July 2025  
**Topics:** Sliding Window, HashMap

**Problems Solved:**
1. ðŸ”— [Subarray Product Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/)
2. ðŸ”— [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
